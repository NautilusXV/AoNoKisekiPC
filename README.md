# Ao No Kiseki PC Texture Pack

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cycopED.png)

This texture pack has some of the textures that were in the PPSSPP version. Pretty much the translated stuff since the game is already in HD. But it does have things that are not in the PPSSPP version though. Whenever the unofficial translation patch is released or the game is officially brought to west, most of the stuff in this pack will be irrelevant.

What to expect:
```
HD KeA (Extra Section)

Playstation 4(DS4) Buttons

Translated Battle Menu(Mostly)

Translated Chapter Title Screens

Edited Character Camp Menu images

Translated Character Names for Camp Menu

```

# Latest Version: Ver. 2.3.8

Download https://github.com/NautilusXV/AoNoKisekiPC/releases

## Installation

Extract contents to your Ao No Kiseki install directory. Overwrite if asked.

**For future updates, delete the previous pack/version before installing the latest release.**

## Notes

I use Kaldaien's SpecialK to inject the textures into Ao. https://tinyurl.com/KaldaienSpecialK

From time to time I may update the version I use with the latest version he releases and reupload the texture pack.

I recommend using superninja2525's PC English patch [Here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/ao-no-kiseki-ppsspp-hd-texture-pack.484790/page-8#post-7944667)

He translated images(.itp files) and text in general of the game as well. But in better quality. I removed "some" of the textures from my pack as a result. Specifically the textures involving the detective notebook. His patch does void a few of my textures from appearing in game, but I'm not really bothered to experiment on why that is.
